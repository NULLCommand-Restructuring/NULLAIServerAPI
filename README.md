# NULL AI Server API

This project is a simple Flask server to handle API requests (primarily created to serve my [ChatFXT](https://github.com/NULLCommand1/ChatFXT) project). It includes 3 main API endpoints to handle user requests: the first is to provide a brief response, the second is to provide a more detailed response using generative text models like GPT, Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc., and the last is to provide image responses from Bing Image Creator. It is based on the core support library [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/).
